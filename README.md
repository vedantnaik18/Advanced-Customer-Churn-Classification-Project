# Advanced-Customer-Churn-Classification-Project
The goal of this project is to use customer demographic and service usage data to forecast customer attrition for a telecom company.  The business can proactively deploy targeted retention measures to lower financial loss and increase customer satisfaction by identifying customers who are at high risk of churning.
